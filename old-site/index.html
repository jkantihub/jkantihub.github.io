      <p>Docker and the way to build an automated container. Docker has been in the news recently.For the uninitiated , Docker is containers on top of the Linux kernel. It specifically deals with automation of software deployments using software containers.You can also look at docker as chroot++. chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. Now lets look at a comparison between docker and Virtual Machines (VM).With x86 virtualization being the norm in modern data centers and cloud providers , its but apparent to do this.</p>

      <p>Anybody who has used google search has a little understanding of search.When google launched gmail a few years back , the idea was to have search + mail and the result is for all to see.Gmail is one of the most popular mail applications. I have used google desktop search in its hay days and would like to admit that with the amount of information one needs to look up , desktop search was a very good option.With the amount of information shared with you increasing on a daily basis , it is but obvious that you need to search.DocFetcher came to my rescue a lot of times but it still needs a lot of work.</p>

      <p>Some stories have to be told. As part of a exercise at home , I was recollecting my earliest impressions of a computer.This brought an interesting reflection to me as to why should I not write a brief on my computing background.So here it is for your reading pleasure.By doing this , my intention is to only tell about things which formed my basis to be a computer engineer. The first visual image of something connected to computers was from the punch cards which we had lying around in our house.My Dad , a BITS Pilani and Roorkee alumnus , used to program computers in the BITS computer center using punch cards.These punch cards stacked in an old almirah were there in our house for a considerable portion of our childhood.</p>

      <p>A lot of times people get into a vicious cycle thinking they can do something. The only thing they merely do is make noise and more noise. The idea to work on a problem is not to make the problem bigger but to fix it. Mitigate it if that is what makes it go away. People adopt different means of resolving problems. They work out in the public to solve problems.</p>

      <p>Free Software journey for Kanti Jadia Somewhere in the year 1997 there was a wave of GNU/Linux running in the tech circles.I was still in college and with a bunch of friends wanting to know what this buzz was about.We bought the latest edition of PC Quest ( the source of computer information in those days).This was probably the first few covers which had a CD which came along. Since we as students did not have access to a computer which we could tweak we settled for magazine and read through the articles.These were early days and we did not have an understanding as to what we will be doing after graduating from college.</p>

Mozilla has come up with a ESR release for all those people who need there own deployment cycle for quality testing etc. Oracle has certified Firefox ESR for the EBS deployments. https://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/firefox_extended_support_release_10 Here is an attachment on the initial release. http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/</p>

      <p>Nagpur Calling On the 24th of Feb I was on a mission.A mission to know if Nagpur is calling or not. The MIHAN SEZ project , the cornerstone of MADC for the Nagpur Airport was being promoted here. The MIHAN project has been in existence for a good part of the last decade and comprises of a cargo hub with Airport and a SEZ with residential zone attached.The unique attributes of the project make it an ideal location in Central India offering immense possibilities of growth.The project aims to act as the catalyst in the growth of Central India ,providing the much needed boost to the economic activity in and around Nagpur.</p>

      <p>Recently Oracle was looking for some feedback on browser usage.The recent Mozilla policy for browser certifications has put them in a dilemma. http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for Mozilla is committing to releasing new Firefox versions every six weeks. Mozilla released Firefox 5 this week. With this release, Mozilla states that Firefox 4 is End-of-Life and will not receive any additional security updates. In a comment thread posted to Mike Kaply&rsquo;s blog article discussing these new Firefox policies, Asa Dotzler from Mozilla stated:&hellip;&hellip; Here is my take on this&hellip; To the point of upgrades , i would like to throw a case in point.Sometime ago the main website for Oracle Support (support.oracle.com) was moved to a flash enabled one.The site simply mentioned that it needs flash version &ldquo;Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115 or above to work&rdquo;.Would this be right for Oracle to say that it needs 9.0.115 only as they certified the website only for this specific version of flash.I would doubt you would do that.You will instead say as long as the basic set of features we need to run this website are available we should be good to get past the version hell.&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt; What i would instead want Oracle to do is to certify on the features( web standards) and than whatever browsers support the standards it would automatically work with the application ( EBS in this case).</p>

      <p>The recent case of allowing access on open wifi routers got a person in the police network[1].His only problem was that he knowingly/unknowingly left his wifi router open for access.At one end of the side you can easily notice the innocence in the case,but if you look at it from the other angle its called a security hole.Anybody with sufficient malafide intent could simply play with this setup and cause problems for the person opening up his network.</p>

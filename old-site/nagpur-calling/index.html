          <p><p><strong>Nagpur Calling</strong></p>

<p>On the 24th of Feb I was on a mission.A mission to know if Nagpur is calling or not.
The MIHAN SEZ project , the cornerstone of MADC for the Nagpur Airport was being promoted here.</p>

<p>The MIHAN project has been in existence for a good part of the last decade and comprises of a cargo hub with Airport and a SEZ with residential zone attached.The unique attributes of the project make it an ideal location in Central India offering immense possibilities of growth.The project aims to act as the catalyst in the growth of Central India ,providing the much needed
boost to the economic activity in and around Nagpur.</p>

<p>Now lets see what really happened at the event.The event was setup in Hotel Center Point in the central part of Nagpur.The distance of the MIHAN project from the hotel was not more than 10 km&rsquo;s.The least in terms of access to an SEZ from the central part of the city.</p>

<p>The VED council has done a very good act to put an excellent event in place  to promote the facilities and economic vitality of Nagpur.&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>The first to come on the dias was Mr.Devendra Parekh, the head for VED Council.He summarized the need for Nagpur to becoming the leader in economic developement.He described the state of Nagpur from being a follower to a challenger,from being a challenger to being a leader.
Nagpur has a lot of positives in terms of development.It has an engineering pool  with about 20,000 graduates available every year.Then there are the regular graduates which amount to around 50,000 ready to access pool of talent.</p>

<p>The next to take the stage was Rajiv Vaishnav.A keen person interested to see the opportunities Nagpur can offer.He identified that Nagpur has all the necessary ingredients to be a great IT/ITES destination.He also showed interest in the various initiatives being taken to make Nagpur a hub for IT/ITES operations.</p>

<p>Then to be on the stage was the current vice chairman of MADC , Mr.U.P.S.Madan.Mr.Madan was pretty straightforward on whatever challenges he was facing.He clarified that the MIHAN project is all set with the best available infrastructure which is ready to boot.
He mentioned pretty clearly identified the last few issues and was more than happy with the progress.With the global slowdown global companies are hunting for good places to complement there operations in major cities and Nagpur is an ideal location to do that.</p>

<p>The next to take the stage was Mr.Nitin Raut, minister from the Govt of Maharashtra.He as well mentioned the facilities of Nagpur and prospects in terms of economic development.</p>

<p>Once the inaugural speeches were done there were a few panel discussions  on the Opportunities and Advantage of Nagpur.</p>

<p>The panelist included Raghavendra K ( Vice President and Head - HR ,Infosys BPO) , Praveen Kamath Kumbla(Head Talent Acquisition, Wipro BPO)
Mr.Ajay Chaturvedi, CEO and Founder HarVa BPO(The rural , all-women BPO) and others.
Companies like Persistent Systems and ADCC infocad also had leading representatives.The idea of Nagpur becoming a first grade IT/ITES destination competing with other cities across the world was being shown with clear advantages.</p>

<p>All in all I was very satisfied to see the growth of Nagpur from being a small place to the 114th largest city in the world.I am thankful to my friends back in Nagpur for taking the initiative in showcasing the advantages of Nagpur in terms of returning and making Nagpur the next destination in the India growth story.</p>

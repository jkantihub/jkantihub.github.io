      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker and the way to build an automated container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker has been in the news recently.For the uninitiated , Docker is containers on top of the Linux kernel.
It specifically deals with automation of software deployments using software containers.You can also look at docker as chroot++.
chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at a comparison between docker and Virtual Machines (VM).With x86 virtualization being the norm in modern data centers and cloud providers , its but apparent to do this.
On a physical machine , you create a set of VMs using KVM,VMware or XEN hypervisor etc.The number of VMs actually represent equivalent physical abstracts.Each VM represnts a full machine.
Containers are in a different paradigm.You create only that parts of the system , which you will actually need.With docker you could have 10x number of applications running on the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets dwell into the  specifics of a docker build.
The three basic items needed are
- The linux kernel with docker engine to run the build
- The Dockerfile ( the script which defines the application as well as all the dependencies needed for the application)
- The build process to spin a container (image) and ability to move it across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recent linux distribution like ubuntu , centos etc would have docker available for install.The latest version is Docker 1.81 as of this writing.
The Dockerfile is the secret sauce.It helps you put together the application image.The more intricate the Dockerfile , the more amount of work would be done.Keep it simple and efficient.
You actually have to program the Dockerfile.It has a specific sequence and artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions popping on my mind was ability to run Graphical ( X based) UI in Docker.Today I got a little chance to do it and the result is at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jkantihub/docker-chrome&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jkantihub/docker-chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look forward to some feedback on the post and any questions which you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How not to be a Computer Engineer.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some stories have to be told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a exercise at home , I was recollecting my earliest impressions of a computer.This brought an interesting reflection to me as to why should I not write a brief on my computing background.So here it is for your reading pleasure.By doing this , my intention is to only tell about things which formed my basis to be a computer engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first visual image of something connected to computers was from the punch cards which we had lying around in our house.My Dad , a BITS Pilani and Roorkee alumnus , used to program computers in the BITS computer center using punch cards.These punch cards stacked in an old almirah were there in our house for a considerable portion of our childhood.
The pungent smell they used to emanate clearly reflected the aging on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Punch cards used to program mainframes.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9kVvjpgV1-XYHPs7MWwzRrZTxBX_clIGoduz4XgDch9OZ1vAGWc3rA4aTFmnaXapfI9auLaHNDH4QXEpWuvzmFd6x3Q1kRhR2TE8B0oenGdHzRW_wf8&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second visual was from a handheld programmable computer which my Dad had bought from his office (somebody had brought it from Japan) for some work.This handheld device was a casio FX series pocket computer which had programmable controls.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;which had programmable controls.We made a small picture of Mahatma Gandhi to see if we could do some programming on this device.It was one of the possibilities on the device apart from being able to print as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three kids at home were super excited and in the melee , we dropped that device to the floor.The LCD screen blacked out partially and that image is edged in my memory from that day onwards.This broken computer was also lying in our house for a long time.My father working for TCE ( Tata Consulting Engineers ) later to be called TCS had to take it in the stride because of this.I don’t have the details as to why we never returned that broken device or what happened after this , but this was the first real computer which i saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]Casio programmable pocket computer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-702P&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-702P&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UkmRv2lM5DMCdTQFFqOGzJw_1eXlJ5pR0JjBmIgimPyZfPy-kzcEpILyyDmHD90sIoBrkVrVSFqTeXp2J2Z39PjK9B97SxaZ5fHT3am4I1YND0EyaUo&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these two incidents above I was merely a spectator and not the guy in action.I don&amp;rsquo;t really know who of us dropped that device to this day.Those early days of school are still fresh in my mind and have a big impact on how I am.I was never in the list of top scorers and being the youngest sibling was more of a pampered kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Taare Zameen Par a few years back brought my earliest memories back.In fact i could associate with it a lot.We used to live in Yoginagar area of Borivali , Bombay (now Mumbai) and I used to study in S.S.Ajmera school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] The earliest photo which I have for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jkanti.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/23022007.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://jkanti.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/23022007.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SSAjmera Kanti Jadia&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We subsequently moved to Nagpur a few years later and I started my studies in a school in Nagpur.My elder brother could not get admission in the same school and had to opt for a fairly low grade school for that one year.Later my brother also got admission to St.John&amp;rsquo;s in his 10th standard.I was on cloud nine those days.I would brag to my classmates how I got to play football with the 10th graders in lunch time.I was still in 5th standard and my elder brother in the highest grade of 10th.My brother subsequently moved on to SFS college ,Sadar where he was preparing for BITS Pilani entrance along with his studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the school we had some computers installed.These were done by engineers from HCL and the computer instructor came from Delhi.These set of computer used to be 80286 and 80386 computers on which we were allowed to play games at times.We were taught DOS,Basic and fundamentals of computer at the time.The recollection on these computers brings to my mind the Mario game which was very popular at that time.This game in fact was the one which we were allowed to play.We had these computer classes for about an year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the way things progressed , my Dad in a conversation set it up that you should do polytechnic and become a Diploma Engineer.A series of events later I ended up taking admission to Diploma in Computer Engineering course in 1995.As part of the studies we had the exposure to the computer lab for our lab courses only.No free access to computers , no personal computers at our disposal at home.Learning computer engineering was more of a theoretical exercise than a practice oriented one.The only lab exercises were for C programming, microprocessor programming etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the lab&amp;rsquo;s one 8085 programmable device got stolen and all the students were further restricted on the access to computer hardware or devices.The stolen device was later found but still the access to computer labs was still limited.All the students opted for extra coaching from outside teachers in order to score good marks but my financial ability was limited at that time and thus had to contend with the limited books I had access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final year of the course computer engineering course I could get some liberty in opting for tuition&amp;rsquo;s.It had very good effect of the extra coaching as the coach was a very seasoned professional.This extra coaching had a very positive effect on the way I worked with computers later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing , I took some odd jobs in the first few months after Diploma and finally landed in a company in December 1998.In the journey of FOSS[5] , I have already detailed on how I got inclined towards GNU/Linux and other aspects of FOSS.Here let me add the other bits of the stories on Java ,Oracle etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java as a language was popularized and marketed pretty well in the late nineties.Working as a partner for Oracle in the local market our company was looking at getting some web connectivity to Oracle database.There was a discussion as  to whether we should go for web enabled projects or web based projects.The demarcation being , existing applications when run through the web browser after limited modifications would be web enabled , and the new ones which are written using html , php , java from scratch would be web based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor for me was to either to continue as an administrator or program and become a developer.I started of with an idea of a project management system(pms) which would be used in house in the office for managing projects.I was free to choose whichever language or technology I wanted , the only condition being that  it has to connect to a Oracle database in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would continue to do my consulting work in the day and whatever time was available used to be in office looking for ways to do other things.I configured the ISDN network to be shared on the network and would browse the internet being the admin as well.A few of the other developers used to also spend time in office due to the incentive of getting free connectivity.We even had a person starting off with chatting and subsequently ending it with a good happy family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came upon me that we would opt for java as the language to write the frontend and connect it to a oracle database.The PMS project was an excuse for me to try different things out and I took full liberty in exploring GNU/Linux instead.Officially if I would want to be part of the development team , i had to have to make this PMS project work and deliver on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that I would be coding in Java was not pleasent in my mind as there were still discussions on the various mailing list if java is really free.How it will be charged etc.The good part was that it was all available to download.So instead of running java on the windows machine , I instead opted for java on linux with blackdown jdk.Here I would like to point to the reader that its overlayed work and so it might not be possible to maintain chronology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the consulting jobs I would go about and around town trying to install odd software or fix broken things.I went to a factory near nagpur where they had a legacy wipro machine which had a disk crash losing major pieces of data.I went and was able to bring up the database.This was a big image boost and subsequently when the machine itself crashed we migrated the entire solution to one of the digital server (x86) with the same dumb terminals and forms 3.0  working.This was legacy unix.On another job I was tasked with a colleague of mine to try and install Oracle on SCO for a university.It was reported that there were already 3-4 attempts to install but had still failed as it was not getting completed.There also we tasted success and we go the solution done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We my day time consulting and work on network solutions , mail solutions etc , i was continuing to explore computing at its best.I went to defence establishments.I went to other cities.Went to remote areas as well.End of it whatever time I used to get , it was used in office to continue working on PMS.I joined a java course as well ( sponsored ) , which was run by a prominent professor from VNIT ( VRCE at that time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on the various software peices , we were trying to find a way to web enable the legacy applications written in Oracle Forms.This was accelarated a bit when Forms 6.0 was launched with the web broker.It used CORBA and IIOP at that time.The initial release of the product was awful.We were able to run it finally but it was just not upto the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMS was developed and later formed the basis for a much larger project management solution.The initial version of PMS was written in Java entirely by me.I was able to deliver on php as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of promotions announced was put with MS IIS which crashed at the clients place within first one hour of operation.As an interim solution I had to put a php solution in place and it survived the load on that day.We had proven free software could scale at 100 feet out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the year 2003 , I moved to Hyderabad ( subsequently Bangalore immediately after training) and started working here.This is how I became a Computer Engineer.More stories to follow later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free Software journey for Kanti Jadia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Free Software journey for Kanti Jadia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the year 1997 there was a wave of GNU/Linux running in the tech circles.I was still in college and with a bunch of friends wanting to know what this buzz was about.We bought the latest edition of PC Quest ( the source of computer information in those days).This was probably the first few covers which had a CD which came along.
Since we as students did not have access to a computer which we could tweak we settled for magazine and read through the articles.These were early days and we did not have an understanding as to what we will be doing after graduating from college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once out of college I was still hunting for a job.Dabbling with different set of initial hurdles I landed a job at Micropro in December 1998.I was employed in the hardware division under the leadership of Mr.Meher Pophali.Working for a client where I had to reinstall the OS , I asked why reinstall the software if the problem can be solved.This inquisitive nature would come very handy to me later.The problem was not really solved as it was a proprietary OS and I did not have the necessary skills with OS specific software.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident led me to do software support more than to do hardware.I was designated to go to customer place and sort software problems.Problems like system not working,printer drivers not working , scanner not working and so on so forth.Slowly and steadily I got exposed to more complex piece of software which were not really written by one person.The concept of software companies and the way they do business became known to me.I got to know of software which needed a dongle to work.The dongle was in place so that at one time only one computer could be used to run the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradually I was put to resolve more complex issues which included installation/configuration and troubleshooting of oracle software,networking,novell, exchange and other products.Then at one point I got a request to install oracle on SCO.Meanwhile in our office there was somebody working on GNU/Linux.He had installed the software of Redhat 5.1 or 5.2.I got interested and wanted to install it myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old hats on this reader list who know about those days would remember how difficult it was to get things working on a GNU/Linux system.Still I was inclined to try things out.The person who had initiated this GNU/Linux churn in our office (Mr.Jitendra Pal) decided to leave micropro and there was a void created.The consulting which we were doing for a client with Pal sir was handed over to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading more and more about GNU/Linux.Building proxy server , mail server , web server etc.We built a backup server with Samba as well so that the users on the network could dump their files onto the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile , we got a new internet connection in our own office.I was designated to make internet connectivity available to everybody in office.I built a proxy server , a mail server systems , some backup solution and so on so forth.There was an incentive given in terms of open access to internet if you come to office a little bit early ( when you have limited resources you tend to put curbs ).There are a lot more interesting stories which I can tell , but leaving them so as not to digress from the topic.We had a series of projects which were executed using GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read more and more about GNU/Linux I got acquainted with licensing aspect, the GPL and Apache license.This led me to delve further and at one point I thought about leaving my job and joining the Free Software foundation in India.I met Dr.Nagarjuna and expressed my desire to help the movement in my capacity.Those were early days for the FSF-I and a lot of things were happening around.The wave of software patents came and It was really needed to stop the patents amendment.The fight against software patents is an ongoing one and will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnunify happened in 2003 , and that was when we had discussions as to how some projects should move forward.I ran a report on gnunify which was widely circulated.[1]
Thanks to Niyam Bhushan ( the LL fame ) we got a nice logo and logotype for FSF-India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I moved to Bangalore and started interacting with other like minded people.I was looking at making FSF-I represent at the Linux Bangalore conference.Eventually in 2005 with the renamed FOSS.IN we were able to get something.Imagine , in 2003 people were asking what FSF-India does [2] and in 2005 we got dedicated space for a stall.I have fond memories of the time me , Praveen and others were working to put the stall up for FSF-India[3].This was a big event where I represented FSF-India as a volunteer.I have been a long time supporter of free software and would continue to be.This is also reflective in my professional career as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on the journey , I am embarking on a new endeavor in my professional life.This one is going to make a few new frontiers again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ending this with words from Geetanjali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where The Mind is Without Fear
From Rabindranath Tagore&amp;rsquo;s Geetanjali
——————————————————–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the mind is without fear
And the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up
Into fragments by narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oracle Ebusiness Suite Browser Certifications.</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-ebusiness-suite-browser-certifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 10:46:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-ebusiness-suite-browser-certifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Oracle was looking for some feedback on browser usage.The recent Mozilla policy for browser certifications has put them in a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for&#34;&gt;http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is committing to releasing new Firefox versions &lt;a href=&#34;http://mozilla.github.com/process-releases/draft/development_specifics/&#34;&gt;every six weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  Mozilla released Firefox 5 this week.  With this release, Mozilla states that Firefox 4 is End-of-Life and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217837/Mozilla_retires_Firefox_4_from_security_support&#34;&gt;will not receive any additional security updates&lt;/a&gt;.  In a comment thread posted to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mike.kaply.com/2011/06/23/understanding-the-corporate-impact/&#34;&gt;Mike Kaply&amp;rsquo;s blog article discussing these new Firefox policies&lt;/a&gt;, Asa Dotzler from Mozilla stated:&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my take on this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the point of upgrades , i would like to throw a case in point.Sometime ago the main website for Oracle Support (support.oracle.com) was moved to a flash enabled one.The site simply mentioned that it needs flash version &amp;ldquo;Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115 or above  to work&amp;rdquo;.Would this be right for Oracle to say that it needs 9.0.115 only as they certified the website only for this specific version of flash.I would doubt you would do that.You will instead say as long as the basic set of features we need to run this website are available we should be good to get past the version hell.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i would instead want Oracle to do is to certify on the features( web standards) and than whatever browsers support the standards it would automatically work with the application ( EBS in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other question is on security updates.This I consider is more important to get by than the version hell.It might appear that the security updates would stop if certain versions of the software are not provided.Please provide 3 examples/points to me why Oracle still support IE6 and IE7 when the company producing it has went to IE9 and soon to be IE X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again refer back to the previous paragraph.Its better we talk about specific browser features than about specific versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since MS is dominant desktop platform today , we might think this is tied to the Operating System version and the upgrade cycle on the OS.Soon in the future with so many tablets and mobile phones (smartphones) around you will start building front ends for these diverse platforms(ipad,android,hp tablets etc).This would be prudent to say that this new set of Operating Systems would also vouch for part of the enterprise space.You will have to certify features on them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this survey , we might be biased to say that upgrades need to planned and the browser is one thick block which is the gateway to the application.I would rather say the browser is the enabler.As long as it provides a certain set of features you should be okay to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop me a personal mail if you think we can discuss it in some other ways.I always see Oracle as one company which can do a significant change in the IT Marketplace.Well change the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is committed to providing the best Web experience for people everywhere, for whom the Web has become such an important part of their daily lives.  Providing updates to Firefox more frequently allows us to secure users against emerging threats and provide the platform for innovation that today’s rich and compelling Web experiences demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla Community has focused our efforts on the needs of the individual user, and prioritized the product roadmap and features accordingly. However, as is the case with many technologies, loyal Firefox users and their IT departments, have sought to bring Firefox into their places of work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;College education is something at which point you are not mature enough to
understand everything but are mature enough to not able to understand at all.I
would like to give you a small story which happened to me many years ago.I was
sitting alone and pondering what i will do on my exams the next day.I was really
in thought if i faired miserably or had a bad day this would make a wreck
out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here came along my elder brother who gave his mind out to me.He said
&amp;ldquo;What you learn in college will stick with you for the lifetime&amp;rdquo;.
The friends and colleagues you make may not be with you , the actual knowledge
will also not be with you.The important thing which will stay with you is the
application of this learning.You will apply the skills you learned in college for
many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of getting good college education thus gets exemplified.You need
to be rooted at all times and keep your feet on the ground.You need to make
optimal use of this opportunity and keep things in perspective.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now , how is this related to the opensource way.The way we comprehend knowledge
and the way it is shared is nearly the same way opensource works.
You get shared knowledge.You get information which has been passed on from
generations.You are in fact standing on the shoulders of giant&amp;rsquo;s and making
the knowledge commons work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very startling fact i discovered recently was the way Salman Khan from
Khanacademy is approaching this.He has successfully been putting together
videos which teach you from the basics to a lot of advance subjects.Subjects
which when learned as a new topic seem difficult at first.I am a big fan of the
Khan Academy.It paves the way for the learning to be self paced and in short
order.You need not sit for a long lecture in a crammed class trying to comprehend
what the professor/teacher just spoke.You keep yourself in the confines of a
comfortable environment and can pace the learning  at the same speed at which
you can comprehend and understand the best.You can always pause the video and
ask a few questions and than resume at the same point.The lessons are not in a
long boring format.Each of the videos is just paced right keeping it in the
confines of around 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this on what basis.He has licensed all his work under a CC license.Anybody
can make use of these lectures in the way they like.There already are so many
different people interested in Khan academy and the way it is working.Here is
wishing best of luck to Salman Khan and here are the three cheers for the
freedom way.The way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

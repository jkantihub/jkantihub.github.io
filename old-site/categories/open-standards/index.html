      <p>Docker and the way to build an automated container. Docker has been in the news recently.For the uninitiated , Docker is containers on top of the Linux kernel. It specifically deals with automation of software deployments using software containers.You can also look at docker as chroot++. chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. Now lets look at a comparison between docker and Virtual Machines (VM).With x86 virtualization being the norm in modern data centers and cloud providers , its but apparent to do this.</p>

      <p>Some stories have to be told. As part of a exercise at home , I was recollecting my earliest impressions of a computer.This brought an interesting reflection to me as to why should I not write a brief on my computing background.So here it is for your reading pleasure.By doing this , my intention is to only tell about things which formed my basis to be a computer engineer. The first visual image of something connected to computers was from the punch cards which we had lying around in our house.My Dad , a BITS Pilani and Roorkee alumnus , used to program computers in the BITS computer center using punch cards.These punch cards stacked in an old almirah were there in our house for a considerable portion of our childhood.</p>

      <p>Free Software journey for Kanti Jadia Somewhere in the year 1997 there was a wave of GNU/Linux running in the tech circles.I was still in college and with a bunch of friends wanting to know what this buzz was about.We bought the latest edition of PC Quest ( the source of computer information in those days).This was probably the first few covers which had a CD which came along. Since we as students did not have access to a computer which we could tweak we settled for magazine and read through the articles.These were early days and we did not have an understanding as to what we will be doing after graduating from college.</p>

      <p>Recently Oracle was looking for some feedback on browser usage.The recent Mozilla policy for browser certifications has put them in a dilemma. http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for Mozilla is committing to releasing new Firefox versions every six weeks. Mozilla released Firefox 5 this week. With this release, Mozilla states that Firefox 4 is End-of-Life and will not receive any additional security updates. In a comment thread posted to Mike Kaply&rsquo;s blog article discussing these new Firefox policies, Asa Dotzler from Mozilla stated:&hellip;&hellip; Here is my take on this&hellip; To the point of upgrades , i would like to throw a case in point.Sometime ago the main website for Oracle Support (support.oracle.com) was moved to a flash enabled one.The site simply mentioned that it needs flash version &ldquo;Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115 or above to work&rdquo;.Would this be right for Oracle to say that it needs 9.0.115 only as they certified the website only for this specific version of flash.I would doubt you would do that.You will instead say as long as the basic set of features we need to run this website are available we should be good to get past the version hell.&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt; What i would instead want Oracle to do is to certify on the features( web standards) and than whatever browsers support the standards it would automatically work with the application ( EBS in this case).</p>

      <p>College education is something at which point you are not mature enough to understand everything but are mature enough to not able to understand at all.I would like to give you a small story which happened to me many years ago.I was sitting alone and pondering what i will do on my exams the next day.I was really in thought if i faired miserably or had a bad day this would make a wreck out of me.</p>

All the Heads of Departments are requested not to put up proposal for purchase of any Office Suite software in future. We are enclosing a 'Open Office' CD and department can further copies as per requirement as it is free to use license software. Now you will ask where is the note published. Lets try and find it out.</p>

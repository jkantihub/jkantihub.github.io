      <title>Google Chrome in Docker</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker and the way to build an automated container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker has been in the news recently.For the uninitiated , Docker is containers on top of the Linux kernel.
It specifically deals with automation of software deployments using software containers.You can also look at docker as chroot++.
chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at a comparison between docker and Virtual Machines (VM).With x86 virtualization being the norm in modern data centers and cloud providers , its but apparent to do this.
On a physical machine , you create a set of VMs using KVM,VMware or XEN hypervisor etc.The number of VMs actually represent equivalent physical abstracts.Each VM represnts a full machine.
Containers are in a different paradigm.You create only that parts of the system , which you will actually need.With docker you could have 10x number of applications running on the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets dwell into theÂ  specifics of a docker build.
The three basic items needed are
- The linux kernel with docker engine to run the build
- The Dockerfile ( the script which defines the application as well as all the dependencies needed for the application)
- The build process to spin a container (image) and ability to move it across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recent linux distribution like ubuntu , centos etc would have docker available for install.The latest version is Docker 1.81 as of this writing.
The Dockerfile is the secret sauce.It helps you put together the application image.The more intricate the Dockerfile , the more amount of work would be done.Keep it simple and efficient.
You actually have to program the Dockerfile.It has a specific sequence and artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the questions popping on my mind was ability to run Graphical ( X based) UI in Docker.Today I got a little chance to do it and the result is at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jkantihub/docker-chrome&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jkantihub/docker-chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look forward to some feedback on the post and any questions which you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has come up with a ESR release for all those people who need there own deployment cycle for quality testing etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle has certified Firefox ESR for the EBS deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Virtual Open Network</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/the-virtual-open-network/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent case of allowing access on open wifi routers got a person in the police network[1].His only problem was that he knowingly/unknowingly left his wifi router open for access.At one end of the side you can easily notice the innocence in the case,but if you look at it from the other angle its called a security hole.Anybody with sufficient malafide intent could simply play with this setup and cause problems for the person opening up his network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this interesting preposition where EFF is encouraging you to share your wifi network[2].The request puts it in perspective as to how it would be a community good if we have had unconditional access to the Internet as you would for your basic rights.In Finland there is a legislation[3] which makes access to Internet a right for every citizen.The use of the Internet is not so common in third world countries but a survey conducted recently concludes
that Internet access helps people increase their knowledge, makes them more open to communication and is a public good.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we could create a network which would allow anyone access to Internet? What if it helped you keep the anonymity on the Internet intact?Imagine situations where you are on the road and need Internet access.You are stuck in a place where there is no standard telecom network.Hilly regions where you are on a trekking trip and find yourself disconnected[4].It would be a nice or must have situation where you want Internet access.To solve these issues we could put together a model which keeps the Internet open and accessible for the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtual open network is nothing but the intent to keep the Internet free for access.To make it omnipresent so that it is available anywhere and everywhere.The need for this is enormous , the technical challenge huge , but is it needed? yes it is.The Internet should be kept open.It should not be locked down by commercial interests and government control.It is part of your digital freedom.Make the Internet just about one more public utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of such a public network is not difficult to find.The electric network is one such example.Imagine a situation where your electricity provider makes it just about impossible for you to get electricity.The cost rise of electricity is just about impossible.Would you look for a way out? Would you opt for a different electricity provider? Yes , if you had that option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need of the day is to ensure we keep the Internet open.We need to continuously thrive for it.We need to keep finding ways to leave it for easy accessibility.We need to keep it anonymous.We need to keep it free.We need to keep it open.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The wave of openid</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/the-wave-of-openid/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of buzz around openid these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has started providing openid services.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently yahoo is an openid provider , but not a consumer yet.&lt;br /&gt;
Some details are at&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/01/yahoo-users-you.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/01/yahoo-users-you.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing which caught my eye was that all major players in web space have taken a step towards openid as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3726771/OpenID+Gets+Star+Power.htm&#34;&gt;http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3726771/OpenID+Gets+Star+Power.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end benefit is you don&amp;rsquo;t have to remember a lot many passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CfP for FOSS.IN/2007</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/cfp-for-fossin2007/</link>

      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/cfp-for-fossin2007/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its nearly the end of the cfP and now the cfP has been restarted.&lt;br /&gt;
This is unprecedented i think but very very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally most of the talks at technical conferences are focussed on users and a few developers.&lt;br /&gt;
This one is different , it is trying to focus on the developers first , that too FOSS developers.&lt;br /&gt;
Should we call this a developer focussed event , no , its still a long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes the first step needs to be right ( &lt;a href=&#34;http://foss.in/2007/info/CfP_Restart&#34;&gt;http://foss.in/2007/info/CfP_Restart&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

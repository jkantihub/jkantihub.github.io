      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some stories have to be told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a exercise at home , I was recollecting my earliest impressions of a computer.This brought an interesting reflection to me as to why should I not write a brief on my computing background.So here it is for your reading pleasure.By doing this , my intention is to only tell about things which formed my basis to be a computer engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first visual image of something connected to computers was from the punch cards which we had lying around in our house.My Dad , a BITS Pilani and Roorkee alumnus , used to program computers in the BITS computer center using punch cards.These punch cards stacked in an old almirah were there in our house for a considerable portion of our childhood.
The pungent smell they used to emanate clearly reflected the aging on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Punch cards used to program mainframes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second visual was from a handheld programmable computer which my Dad had bought from his office (somebody had brought it from Japan) for some work.This handheld device was a casio FX series pocket computer which had programmable controls.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;which had programmable controls.We made a small picture of Mahatma Gandhi to see if we could do some programming on this device.It was one of the possibilities on the device apart from being able to print as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three kids at home were super excited and in the melee , we dropped that device to the floor.The LCD screen blacked out partially and that image is edged in my memory from that day onwards.This broken computer was also lying in our house for a long time.My father working for TCE ( Tata Consulting Engineers ) later to be called TCS had to take it in the stride because of this.I don’t have the details as to why we never returned that broken device or what happened after this , but this was the first real computer which i saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]Casio programmable pocket computer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-702P&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-702P&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UkmRv2lM5DMCdTQFFqOGzJw_1eXlJ5pR0JjBmIgimPyZfPy-kzcEpILyyDmHD90sIoBrkVrVSFqTeXp2J2Z39PjK9B97SxaZ5fHT3am4I1YND0EyaUo&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these two incidents above I was merely a spectator and not the guy in action.I don&amp;rsquo;t really know who of us dropped that device to this day.Those early days of school are still fresh in my mind and have a big impact on how I am.I was never in the list of top scorers and being the youngest sibling was more of a pampered kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Taare Zameen Par a few years back brought my earliest memories back.In fact i could associate with it a lot.We used to live in Yoginagar area of Borivali , Bombay (now Mumbai) and I used to study in S.S.Ajmera school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3] The earliest photo which I have for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jkanti.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/23022007.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://jkanti.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/23022007.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;SSAjmera Kanti Jadia&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We subsequently moved to Nagpur a few years later and I started my studies in a school in Nagpur.My elder brother could not get admission in the same school and had to opt for a fairly low grade school for that one year.Later my brother also got admission to St.John&amp;rsquo;s in his 10th standard.I was on cloud nine those days.I would brag to my classmates how I got to play football with the 10th graders in lunch time.I was still in 5th standard and my elder brother in the highest grade of 10th.My brother subsequently moved on to SFS college ,Sadar where he was preparing for BITS Pilani entrance along with his studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the school we had some computers installed.These were done by engineers from HCL and the computer instructor came from Delhi.These set of computer used to be 80286 and 80386 computers on which we were allowed to play games at times.We were taught DOS,Basic and fundamentals of computer at the time.The recollection on these computers brings to my mind the Mario game which was very popular at that time.This game in fact was the one which we were allowed to play.We had these computer classes for about an year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the way things progressed , my Dad in a conversation set it up that you should do polytechnic and become a Diploma Engineer.A series of events later I ended up taking admission to Diploma in Computer Engineering course in 1995.As part of the studies we had the exposure to the computer lab for our lab courses only.No free access to computers , no personal computers at our disposal at home.Learning computer engineering was more of a theoretical exercise than a practice oriented one.The only lab exercises were for C programming, microprocessor programming etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the lab&amp;rsquo;s one 8085 programmable device got stolen and all the students were further restricted on the access to computer hardware or devices.The stolen device was later found but still the access to computer labs was still limited.All the students opted for extra coaching from outside teachers in order to score good marks but my financial ability was limited at that time and thus had to contend with the limited books I had access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final year of the course computer engineering course I could get some liberty in opting for tuition&amp;rsquo;s.It had very good effect of the extra coaching as the coach was a very seasoned professional.This extra coaching had a very positive effect on the way I worked with computers later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing , I took some odd jobs in the first few months after Diploma and finally landed in a company in December 1998.In the journey of FOSS[5] , I have already detailed on how I got inclined towards GNU/Linux and other aspects of FOSS.Here let me add the other bits of the stories on Java ,Oracle etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java as a language was popularized and marketed pretty well in the late nineties.Working as a partner for Oracle in the local market our company was looking at getting some web connectivity to Oracle database.There was a discussion as  to whether we should go for web enabled projects or web based projects.The demarcation being , existing applications when run through the web browser after limited modifications would be web enabled , and the new ones which are written using html , php , java from scratch would be web based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important factor for me was to either to continue as an administrator or program and become a developer.I started of with an idea of a project management system(pms) which would be used in house in the office for managing projects.I was free to choose whichever language or technology I wanted , the only condition being that  it has to connect to a Oracle database in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would continue to do my consulting work in the day and whatever time was available used to be in office looking for ways to do other things.I configured the ISDN network to be shared on the network and would browse the internet being the admin as well.A few of the other developers used to also spend time in office due to the incentive of getting free connectivity.We even had a person starting off with chatting and subsequently ending it with a good happy family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came upon me that we would opt for java as the language to write the frontend and connect it to a oracle database.The PMS project was an excuse for me to try different things out and I took full liberty in exploring GNU/Linux instead.Officially if I would want to be part of the development team , i had to have to make this PMS project work and deliver on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that I would be coding in Java was not pleasent in my mind as there were still discussions on the various mailing list if java is really free.How it will be charged etc.The good part was that it was all available to download.So instead of running java on the windows machine , I instead opted for java on linux with blackdown jdk.Here I would like to point to the reader that its overlayed work and so it might not be possible to maintain chronology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the consulting jobs I would go about and around town trying to install odd software or fix broken things.I went to a factory near nagpur where they had a legacy wipro machine which had a disk crash losing major pieces of data.I went and was able to bring up the database.This was a big image boost and subsequently when the machine itself crashed we migrated the entire solution to one of the digital server (x86) with the same dumb terminals and forms 3.0  working.This was legacy unix.On another job I was tasked with a colleague of mine to try and install Oracle on SCO for a university.It was reported that there were already 3-4 attempts to install but had still failed as it was not getting completed.There also we tasted success and we go the solution done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We my day time consulting and work on network solutions , mail solutions etc , i was continuing to explore computing at its best.I went to defence establishments.I went to other cities.Went to remote areas as well.End of it whatever time I used to get , it was used in office to continue working on PMS.I joined a java course as well ( sponsored ) , which was run by a prominent professor from VNIT ( VRCE at that time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on the various software peices , we were trying to find a way to web enable the legacy applications written in Oracle Forms.This was accelarated a bit when Forms 6.0 was launched with the web broker.It used CORBA and IIOP at that time.The initial release of the product was awful.We were able to run it finally but it was just not upto the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PMS was developed and later formed the basis for a much larger project management solution.The initial version of PMS was written in Java entirely by me.I was able to deliver on php as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of promotions announced was put with MS IIS which crashed at the clients place within first one hour of operation.As an interim solution I had to put a php solution in place and it survived the load on that day.We had proven free software could scale at 100 feet out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of the year 2003 , I moved to Hyderabad ( subsequently Bangalore immediately after training) and started working here.This is how I became a Computer Engineer.More stories to follow later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oracle Ebusiness Suite Browser Certifications.</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-ebusiness-suite-browser-certifications/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 10:46:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-ebusiness-suite-browser-certifications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Oracle was looking for some feedback on browser usage.The recent Mozilla policy for browser certifications has put them in a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for&#34;&gt;http://blogs.oracle.com/stevenChan/entry/survey_your_enterprise_plans_for&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is committing to releasing new Firefox versions &lt;a href=&#34;http://mozilla.github.com/process-releases/draft/development_specifics/&#34;&gt;every six weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  Mozilla released Firefox 5 this week.  With this release, Mozilla states that Firefox 4 is End-of-Life and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217837/Mozilla_retires_Firefox_4_from_security_support&#34;&gt;will not receive any additional security updates&lt;/a&gt;.  In a comment thread posted to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mike.kaply.com/2011/06/23/understanding-the-corporate-impact/&#34;&gt;Mike Kaply&amp;rsquo;s blog article discussing these new Firefox policies&lt;/a&gt;, Asa Dotzler from Mozilla stated:&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my take on this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the point of upgrades , i would like to throw a case in point.Sometime ago the main website for Oracle Support (support.oracle.com) was moved to a flash enabled one.The site simply mentioned that it needs flash version &amp;ldquo;Adobe Flash Player 9.0.115 or above  to work&amp;rdquo;.Would this be right for Oracle to say that it needs 9.0.115 only as they certified the website only for this specific version of flash.I would doubt you would do that.You will instead say as long as the basic set of features we need to run this website are available we should be good to get past the version hell.&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; more &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i would instead want Oracle to do is to certify on the features( web standards) and than whatever browsers support the standards it would automatically work with the application ( EBS in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other question is on security updates.This I consider is more important to get by than the version hell.It might appear that the security updates would stop if certain versions of the software are not provided.Please provide 3 examples/points to me why Oracle still support IE6 and IE7 when the company producing it has went to IE9 and soon to be IE X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again refer back to the previous paragraph.Its better we talk about specific browser features than about specific versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since MS is dominant desktop platform today , we might think this is tied to the Operating System version and the upgrade cycle on the OS.Soon in the future with so many tablets and mobile phones (smartphones) around you will start building front ends for these diverse platforms(ipad,android,hp tablets etc).This would be prudent to say that this new set of Operating Systems would also vouch for part of the enterprise space.You will have to certify features on them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this survey , we might be biased to say that upgrades need to planned and the browser is one thick block which is the gateway to the application.I would rather say the browser is the enabler.As long as it provides a certain set of features you should be okay to move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop me a personal mail if you think we can discuss it in some other ways.I always see Oracle as one company which can do a significant change in the IT Marketplace.Well change the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is committed to providing the best Web experience for people everywhere, for whom the Web has become such an important part of their daily lives.  Providing updates to Firefox more frequently allows us to secure users against emerging threats and provide the platform for innovation that today’s rich and compelling Web experiences demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla Community has focused our efforts on the needs of the individual user, and prioritized the product roadmap and features accordingly. However, as is the case with many technologies, loyal Firefox users and their IT departments, have sought to bring Firefox into their places of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/06/28/firefox-in-the-enterprise/&#34;&gt;http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/06/28/firefox-in-the-enterprise/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oracle Weblogic Server 10.3.1 FMW 11g</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-weblogic-server-1031-fmw-11g/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2009 06:27:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/oracle-weblogic-server-1031-fmw-11g/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Weblogic 10.3.1  install review for FMW 11g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weblogic is the base java container for FMW 11g.The first piece of software you will put for any FMW 11g install.Oracle Weblogic Server is a collection of the application server,admin console and other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I like about the install is the number of options you have.The install can be done online using the net installer or using the downloaded software.You have a text as well as gui based installer.You can also script the install for silent mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install creates a middleware home for you.This will be the top level directory under which additional FMW 11g components would be installed.In weblogic , each OC4J container is now a domain.As you install the various components eg. Forms,Reports etc new domains get created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 108 different ways you could have Oracle Application Server 10g put into use.With Fusion Middleware 11g I can see much more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fusion Middleware 11g , another look at the architecture.</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/fusion-middleware-11g-another-look-at-the-architecture/</link>

      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/fusion-middleware-11g-another-look-at-the-architecture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oracle released Fusion Middleware 11g recently.This release has a lot of changes.
To enumerate a few , weblogic is now the core java container.Apart from this ,11g identity management uses Access Manager as the authorization broker.There are more such subtle gems hidden inside the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional components like Forms,Reports, Portal and Webcache continue to make
use of SSO and OIDDAS.These components need a lot more detailed planning before you even start thinking of installation.So , if you have Ebusiness Suite added in the gamit , your options are a bit limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good part is that you have so many components and ways you could lay your architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual install options would be covered in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FMW 11g&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/netbackup-and-oracle_link/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you need to configure the Oracle database with netbackup you need to set up a link from the netbackup client to ORACLE_HOME.
The simplest way is to go to netbackup/bin and execute the &amp;ldquo;oracle_link&amp;rdquo; script.
The script links libobk.a64 to $ORACLE_HOME/lib/libobk.a64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common error here is
&amp;ldquo;ORA-27211: Failed to load Media Management Library&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking at the way things are webcenter seems to be the Portal offering which would be promoted the most.
Oracle Portal was the earlier product offering.oPortal has been around for quite some time and the migration from Oracle Portal to Webcenter should now be given a serious thought.
Aqualogic Portal is also an interesting offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see who wins the customer&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pointing the Oracle inventory to proper ORACLE_HOME after cloning</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/pointing-the-oracle-inventory-to-proper-oracle_home-after-cloning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 13:09:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/pointing-the-oracle-inventory-to-proper-oracle_home-after-cloning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once the clone of a database is done it is required that it be associated with the proper inventory.
There are a number of ways one can do this but the best according to me is to use runInstaller itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure to do this is to use the attachhome option of runInstaller from the $ORACLE_HOME/oui/bin directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./runInstaller -silent -attachHome ORACLE_HOME=&amp;quot;/app/oracle/database/10.2.0&amp;quot; ORACLE_HOME_NAME=&amp;quot;databasename&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting Oracle Universal Installer&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No pre-requisite checks found in oraparam.ini, no system pre-requisite checks will be executed.
The inventory pointer is located at /etc/oraInst.loc
The inventory is located at /home/oracle/oraInventory
&amp;lsquo;AttachHome&amp;rsquo; was successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will update the inventory&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using staticports.ini when installing Oracle Application Server</title>
      <link>http://jkantihub.github.io/using-staticportsini-when-installing-oracle-application-server/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 13:00:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://jkantihub.github.io/using-staticportsini-when-installing-oracle-application-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While installing Oracle application server for a number of reasons you would want that you can control the ports configuration.
The best way to do this on a new install is to use &lt;strong&gt;staticports.ini&lt;/strong&gt; file to specify the ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample staticports.ini is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
## staticports.ini - default

# J2EE and HTTP Server
Oracle HTTP Server port = 7777
Oracle HTTP Server Listen port = 7777
Oracle HTTP Server SSL port = 4443
Oracle HTTP Server Listen (SSL) port = 4443
Oracle HTTP Server Diagnostic port = 7200
Java Object Cache port = 7000
DCM Discovery port = 7100
Oracle Notification Server Request port = 6003
Oracle Notification Server Local port = 6101
Oracle Notification Server Remote port = 6200
Application Server Control port = 18100
Application Server Control RMI port = 18140
Oracle Management Agent port = 18120
Log Loader port = 44000
ASG port = 7890

# Infrastructure
Oracle Internet Directory port = 1389
Oracle Internet Directory (SSL) port = 1636

Enterprise Manager Console HTTP Port (orcl) = 5500
Enterprise Manager Agent Port (orcl) = 1830

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post comments with your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

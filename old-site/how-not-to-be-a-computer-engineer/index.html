          <p><p>Some stories have to be told.</p>

<p>As part of a exercise at home , I was recollecting my earliest impressions of a computer.This brought an interesting reflection to me as to why should I not write a brief on my computing background.So here it is for your reading pleasure.By doing this , my intention is to only tell about things which formed my basis to be a computer engineer.</p>

<p>The first visual image of something connected to computers was from the punch cards which we had lying around in our house.My Dad , a BITS Pilani and Roorkee alumnus , used to program computers in the BITS computer center using punch cards.These punch cards stacked in an old almirah were there in our house for a considerable portion of our childhood.
The pungent smell they used to emanate clearly reflected the aging on them.</p>

</p>

<p>The second visual was from a handheld programmable computer which my Dad had bought from his office (somebody had brought it from Japan) for some work.This handheld device was a casio FX series pocket computer which had programmable controls.&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt;which had programmable controls.We made a small picture of Mahatma Gandhi to see if we could do some programming on this device.It was one of the possibilities on the device apart from being able to print as well.</p>

<p>All three kids at home were super excited and in the melee , we dropped that device to the floor.The LCD screen blacked out partially and that image is edged in my memory from that day onwards.This broken computer was also lying in our house for a long time.My father working for TCE ( Tata Consulting Engineers ) later to be called TCS had to take it in the stride because of this.I don’t have the details as to why we never returned that broken device or what happened after this , but this was the first real computer which i saw.</p>

<p>In these two incidents above I was merely a spectator and not the guy in action.I don&rsquo;t really know who of us dropped that device to this day.Those early days of school are still fresh in my mind and have a big impact on how I am.I was never in the list of top scorers and being the youngest sibling was more of a pampered kid.</p>

<p>Watching Taare Zameen Par a few years back brought my earliest memories back.In fact i could associate with it a lot.We used to live in Yoginagar area of Borivali , Bombay (now Mumbai) and I used to study in S.S.Ajmera school.</p>

<p>We subsequently moved to Nagpur a few years later and I started my studies in a school in Nagpur.My elder brother could not get admission in the same school and had to opt for a fairly low grade school for that one year.Later my brother also got admission to St.John&rsquo;s in his 10th standard.I was on cloud nine those days.I would brag to my classmates how I got to play football with the 10th graders in lunch time.I was still in 5th standard and my elder brother in the highest grade of 10th.My brother subsequently moved on to SFS college ,Sadar where he was preparing for BITS Pilani entrance along with his studies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the school we had some computers installed.These were done by engineers from HCL and the computer instructor came from Delhi.These set of computer used to be 80286 and 80386 computers on which we were allowed to play games at times.We were taught DOS,Basic and fundamentals of computer at the time.The recollection on these computers brings to my mind the Mario game which was very popular at that time.This game in fact was the one which we were allowed to play.We had these computer classes for about an year or so.</p>

<p>Due to the way things progressed , my Dad in a conversation set it up that you should do polytechnic and become a Diploma Engineer.A series of events later I ended up taking admission to Diploma in Computer Engineering course in 1995.As part of the studies we had the exposure to the computer lab for our lab courses only.No free access to computers , no personal computers at our disposal at home.Learning computer engineering was more of a theoretical exercise than a practice oriented one.The only lab exercises were for C programming, microprocessor programming etc.</p>

<p>In one of the lab&rsquo;s one 8085 programmable device got stolen and all the students were further restricted on the access to computer hardware or devices.The stolen device was later found but still the access to computer labs was still limited.All the students opted for extra coaching from outside teachers in order to score good marks but my financial ability was limited at that time and thus had to contend with the limited books I had access to.</p>

<p>In the final year of the course computer engineering course I could get some liberty in opting for tuition&rsquo;s.It had very good effect of the extra coaching as the coach was a very seasoned professional.This extra coaching had a very positive effect on the way I worked with computers later.</p>

<p>Continuing , I took some odd jobs in the first few months after Diploma and finally landed in a company in December 1998.In the journey of FOSS[5] , I have already detailed on how I got inclined towards GNU/Linux and other aspects of FOSS.Here let me add the other bits of the stories on Java ,Oracle etc.</p>

<p>Java as a language was popularized and marketed pretty well in the late nineties.Working as a partner for Oracle in the local market our company was looking at getting some web connectivity to Oracle database.There was a discussion as  to whether we should go for web enabled projects or web based projects.The demarcation being , existing applications when run through the web browser after limited modifications would be web enabled , and the new ones which are written using html , php , java from scratch would be web based.</p>

<p>The most important factor for me was to either to continue as an administrator or program and become a developer.I started of with an idea of a project management system(pms) which would be used in house in the office for managing projects.I was free to choose whichever language or technology I wanted , the only condition being that  it has to connect to a Oracle database in the end.</p>

<p>I would continue to do my consulting work in the day and whatever time was available used to be in office looking for ways to do other things.I configured the ISDN network to be shared on the network and would browse the internet being the admin as well.A few of the other developers used to also spend time in office due to the incentive of getting free connectivity.We even had a person starting off with chatting and subsequently ending it with a good happy family.</p>

<p>It came upon me that we would opt for java as the language to write the frontend and connect it to a oracle database.The PMS project was an excuse for me to try different things out and I took full liberty in exploring GNU/Linux instead.Officially if I would want to be part of the development team , i had to have to make this PMS project work and deliver on it.</p>

<p>The realization that I would be coding in Java was not pleasent in my mind as there were still discussions on the various mailing list if java is really free.How it will be charged etc.The good part was that it was all available to download.So instead of running java on the windows machine , I instead opted for java on linux with blackdown jdk.Here I would like to point to the reader that its overlayed work and so it might not be possible to maintain chronology.</p>

<p>As part of the consulting jobs I would go about and around town trying to install odd software or fix broken things.I went to a factory near nagpur where they had a legacy wipro machine which had a disk crash losing major pieces of data.I went and was able to bring up the database.This was a big image boost and subsequently when the machine itself crashed we migrated the entire solution to one of the digital server (x86) with the same dumb terminals and forms 3.0  working.This was legacy unix.On another job I was tasked with a colleague of mine to try and install Oracle on SCO for a university.It was reported that there were already 3-4 attempts to install but had still failed as it was not getting completed.There also we tasted success and we go the solution done.</p>

<p>We my day time consulting and work on network solutions , mail solutions etc , i was continuing to explore computing at its best.I went to defence establishments.I went to other cities.Went to remote areas as well.End of it whatever time I used to get , it was used in office to continue working on PMS.I joined a java course as well ( sponsored ) , which was run by a prominent professor from VNIT ( VRCE at that time).</p>

<p>While working on the various software peices , we were trying to find a way to web enable the legacy applications written in Oracle Forms.This was accelarated a bit when Forms 6.0 was launched with the web broker.It used CORBA and IIOP at that time.The initial release of the product was awful.We were able to run it finally but it was just not upto the mark.</p>

<p>PMS was developed and later formed the basis for a much larger project management solution.The initial version of PMS was written in Java entirely by me.I was able to deliver on php as well.</p>

<p>The list of promotions announced was put with MS IIS which crashed at the clients place within first one hour of operation.As an interim solution I had to put a php solution in place and it survived the load on that day.We had proven free software could scale at 100 feet out of the box.</p>

<p>Nearing the end of the year 2003 , I moved to Hyderabad ( subsequently Bangalore immediately after training) and started working here.This is how I became a Computer Engineer.More stories to follow later.</p>

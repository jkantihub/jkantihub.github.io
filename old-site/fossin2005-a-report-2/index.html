T-Shirt.Would upload the images in<br></br>some time.<br></br><br></br>The format of the FOSS expo area was known to us and the idea of a stall was<br></br>a bit off.<br></br>I got myself registered as a delegate and headed straight to the FOSS Expo<br></br>area.<br></br>The FOSS Expo area had nobody in at that time so i headed to Intel hall (<br></br>750 seater ).<br></br>As i was moving towards the hall i met Gaurav Nawani.<br></br>Gaurav mentioned that he would be putting up a demo of Blender in the FOSS<br></br>Expo Area.<br></br>He mentioned that he and his elder brother run a company (IronCode) and they<br></br>make games.<br></br>I enquired as to what kind of games they wrote and he mentioned casual<br></br>games.<br></br>The kind of games you enjoy playing in your liesure time.<br></br>We both went inside the hall and sat there for the opening to be announced<br></br><br></br>The conference was opened with the lighting up of a lamp ( having five sides<br></br>) , traditionally<br></br>called a Samai ( Sa-Maa-eeee ), by representatives of various GLUGs across<br></br>India ( 5 ).<br></br>The conference theme was very well described by the following poem.<br></br><br></br>Where The Mind is Without Fear<br></br>From Rabindranath Tagore&rsquo;s Geetanjali<br></br>——————————————————–<br></br><br></br>Where the mind is without fear<br></br>And the head is held high<br></br>Where knowledge is free<br></br>Where the world has not been broken up<br></br>Into fragments by narrow domestic walls<br></br>Where words come out from the depth of truth<br></br>Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br></br>Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br></br>Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br></br>Where the mind is led forward by thee<br></br>Into ever-widening thought and action<br></br>Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake<br></br><br></br>The first keynote was given by Alan Cox on the relevance of getting involved<br></br>with Free Software.<br></br>The red coloured cap (hat) worn by Alan was quite evident and only when he<br></br>reached the end of the keynote did<br></br>he remove it.The cap was visible for all four days of the event and you were<br></br>sure to see Alan every once in a while.<br></br>The most interesting part of the talk for me was the part where he mentioned<br></br>that you can just<br></br>get involved with a web browser and an email account.<br></br>Where do you find this small a need to get involved with any sort of<br></br>project.<br></br>The benefits of working with FOSS projects are immense.<br></br>Apart from programming skills which you gain you get to know a lot of<br></br>different people.<br></br>You learn how to interact with people from various cultures.<br></br><br></br>Once the keynote by Alan got through i walked in straight to the FOSS Expo<br></br>Area.<br></br>Karunakar was already there with 3 machines being put up for IndLinux<br></br>project.<br></br>Next to the IndLinux machines was a demo of LTSP put up by ILUG-DELHI guys.<br></br>Gaurav was along with me as well looking where to put his Blender<br></br>demo.Wegot 3 machines and got them unpacked.<br></br>I went ahead and put the GNU &amp; Penguin sticker on one of the machines from<br></br>the ones i had.<br></br>After a bit of groupalla ( get together ), we had the machines ready.<br></br>I had a couple of posters with me which and brouchers for FSF-India and<br></br>SPACE.<br></br>A small lesson , do not expect to find gum/sticking/pins etc near the venue.<br></br>Saw Kartik Mistry putting the Debian poster and so ran out to get some<br></br>cellotape/pins from him.<br></br>A lot of people were around including Karunakar,Jaldhar , Mahesh Pai, Gora<br></br>Mohanty, Pramode<br></br>, Arjun etc.<br></br><br></br>At around afternoon i saw Alan coming inside the FOSS Expo Area, and in a<br></br>few mins he was not to be seen.<br></br>After some time Atul appeared and requested that the FOSS Expo area would<br></br>also move to the Conference Expo area.<br></br>We thought we would all move the out in the morning and than in a flash we<br></br>were all out that area.<br></br>By this time Amol and Sameer came in too from Delhi.<br></br><br></br>We got a dedicated stall for FSF-India and this meant we were back to where<br></br>we started.<br></br>We got the machines in place and then got a few posters put as well.<br></br>Anush was very keen on getting those posters as he felt they were very<br></br>impressive( Indeed they are ).<br></br><br></br>All along the four days we were kind of doing a round robin on the FSF-India<br></br>stall.<br></br>Sometimes it was me , sometimes Amol, another time Sameer and offcourse<br></br>Praveen.<br></br><br></br>Praveen was sharing with me some details on the talks going on in the<br></br>Ballroom as he was the hall marshal there.<br></br>In all i attended around six/seven talks/bofs.<br></br>The food was good with you paying in paper coupens(with options of<br></br>South/North Indian and Pizzas ).<br></br>The T-Shirt also was is good and i hope it hangs around upto next year.<br></br><br></br>Am surprised at the low amount of information people have about FSF.<br></br>People do not even know where gcc came from.<br></br>I was kind of letting people know about FSF in India and its activities.<br></br>FSF-India would be soon launching a fellowship programme and details about<br></br>the same ( <a href="http://www.fsf.org.in/new/fellowship" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.fsf.org.in/new/fellowship">http://www.fsf.org.in/new/fellowship</a></a> )<br></br>are there on the website.<br></br>It was not too difficult to let people know about the GNU project.A lot of<br></br>people were curious as to what we<br></br>were doing on the stall.We gladly told that we had put it up as volunteers<br></br>to FSF-India.<br></br><br></br>Apart from working on the stall we had one more bonus,very good internet<br></br>connectivity.<br></br>Got sarge working on both the machines on the stall and then i set out a<br></br>small task for myself.<br></br>All three days except the first day i was hacking on GCJ and trying to get<br></br>it working with SWT/GTK<br></br>I had to compile it from source as the linking was not done with gcj 4.0.<br></br>Once i got SWT working i moved ahead to java-gnome.<br></br>Getting java-gnome to work was not that tough either.<br></br>So now i had a small image viewer working with java-gnome compiled into<br></br>native binary(linked to libgcj offcourse).<br></br>A complete free java application.( No not yet )<br></br>We had only one Cat5 LAN cable in the stall so only one machine from the<br></br>stall could be on the network at any time.<br></br><br></br>Eclipse has made immense progress in combination with GCJ.<br></br>You can get native applications from GCJ fairly quick.<br></br>Got Java skills , go ahead , try out GCJ.<br></br><br></br>The very next stall to FSF-India was of the Phoenix project (<br></br><a href="http://www.nsc.res.in/%7Eelab/phoenix/" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.nsc.res.in/~elab/phoenix/">http://www.nsc.res.in/~elab/phoenix/</a></a>)<br></br>Pramode ( <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pramode_ce/" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pramode_ce/">http://www.livejournal.com/users/pramode_ce/</a></a> ) was the person<br></br>behind this project being presented<br></br>at FOSS.IN. The project showed how to perform simple experiments using<br></br>locally available hardware and a few<br></br>programs in python.The project has a lot of interest and it would be very<br></br>good for a lo
    t of LABs (Schools, Coleges etc.) to<br></br>implement it.Prof. Vasant Barve ( now retired ) was there too as a<br></br>delegate.He mentioned about his programs written in TC.<br></br>We asked him if he had named his project and whether he was interested in<br></br>porting them to GNU/Linux.<br></br>He is indeed very much interested.Pramod took this oppurtunity of<br></br>introducing SPACE to Prof. Barve.<br></br>Prof.Barve used to teach at College of Engineering in Pune and some other<br></br>colleges from 1967 onwards.<br></br>The College of engineering in Pune has its own long heritage.<br></br>A lot of CDAC engineers knew/know Prof.Barve very well.<br></br><br></br>It would be really nice to have the programs/experiments available on<br></br>GNU/Linux.<br></br>Physics/Mechanics teachers and students both would benefit a lot from these<br></br>programs.<br></br>The software is not yet named , Prof. Barve calls it Virtual Laboratory,<br></br>lets see what name it takes here on.<br></br><br></br>The closing of the conference was also very interesting in a number of ways.<br></br>Volker&rsquo;s talk on Creative Commons was really informative.<br></br>He explained the various forms of commons.The social structure etc. etc.<br></br>Than he went on to tell about the effect of copyleft (GNU GPL) and the GNU<br></br>Project on the various other<br></br>forms of media.The formation of the creative commons and content available<br></br>under<br></br>the creative commons.<br></br>Incidently the FOSS.IN DVD has music available under the Creative Commons<br></br>Free Software has changed the way a lot of things are done in this world.<br></br><br></br>Next Atul took onto the stage to announce the closure with a couple of<br></br>interesting details.<br></br>He introduced the entire team which was responsible for FOSS.IN and they<br></br>lined up near the stage.<br></br>Than came the list of the speakers , a whopping one at that.<br></br>The speakers when lined up showed that it was not he/him or her that were<br></br>making the difference.<br></br>The difference was made by us all.We the people.<br></br><br></br>Copyright &copy; 2005 Kanti Jadia<br></br>Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article are permitted<br></br>worldwide without royalty in any medium provided this notice is preserved<br></br></p>

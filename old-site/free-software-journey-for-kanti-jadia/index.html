          <p><p>Free Software journey for Kanti Jadia</p>

<p>Somewhere in the year 1997 there was a wave of GNU/Linux running in the tech circles.I was still in college and with a bunch of friends wanting to know what this buzz was about.We bought the latest edition of PC Quest ( the source of computer information in those days).This was probably the first few covers which had a CD which came along.
Since we as students did not have access to a computer which we could tweak we settled for magazine and read through the articles.These were early days and we did not have an understanding as to what we will be doing after graduating from college.</p>

<p>Once out of college I was still hunting for a job.Dabbling with different set of initial hurdles I landed a job at Micropro in December 1998.I was employed in the hardware division under the leadership of Mr.Meher Pophali.Working for a client where I had to reinstall the OS , I asked why reinstall the software if the problem can be solved.This inquisitive nature would come very handy to me later.The problem was not really solved as it was a proprietary OS and I did not have the necessary skills with OS specific software.&lt;!&ndash; more &ndash;&gt;</p>

<p>This incident led me to do software support more than to do hardware.I was designated to go to customer place and sort software problems.Problems like system not working,printer drivers not working , scanner not working and so on so forth.Slowly and steadily I got exposed to more complex piece of software which were not really written by one person.The concept of software companies and the way they do business became known to me.I got to know of software which needed a dongle to work.The dongle was in place so that at one time only one computer could be used to run the software.</p>

<p>Gradually I was put to resolve more complex issues which included installation/configuration and troubleshooting of oracle software,networking,novell, exchange and other products.Then at one point I got a request to install oracle on SCO.Meanwhile in our office there was somebody working on GNU/Linux.He had installed the software of Redhat 5.1 or 5.2.I got interested and wanted to install it myself.</p>

<p>The old hats on this reader list who know about those days would remember how difficult it was to get things working on a GNU/Linux system.Still I was inclined to try things out.The person who had initiated this GNU/Linux churn in our office (Mr.Jitendra Pal) decided to leave micropro and there was a void created.The consulting which we were doing for a client with Pal sir was handed over to me.</p>

<p>I started reading more and more about GNU/Linux.Building proxy server , mail server , web server etc.We built a backup server with Samba as well so that the users on the network could dump their files onto the network.</p>

<p>Meanwhile , we got a new internet connection in our own office.I was designated to make internet connectivity available to everybody in office.I built a proxy server , a mail server systems , some backup solution and so on so forth.There was an incentive given in terms of open access to internet if you come to office a little bit early ( when you have limited resources you tend to put curbs ).There are a lot more interesting stories which I can tell , but leaving them so as not to digress from the topic.We had a series of projects which were executed using GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>As I read more and more about GNU/Linux I got acquainted with licensing aspect, the GPL and Apache license.This led me to delve further and at one point I thought about leaving my job and joining the Free Software foundation in India.I met Dr.Nagarjuna and expressed my desire to help the movement in my capacity.Those were early days for the FSF-I and a lot of things were happening around.The wave of software patents came and It was really needed to stop the patents amendment.The fight against software patents is an ongoing one and will continue.</p>

<p>Gnunify happened in 2003 , and that was when we had discussions as to how some projects should move forward.I ran a report on gnunify which was widely circulated.[1]
Thanks to Niyam Bhushan ( the LL fame ) we got a nice logo and logotype for FSF-India.</p>

<p>Then I moved to Bangalore and started interacting with other like minded people.I was looking at making FSF-I represent at the Linux Bangalore conference.Eventually in 2005 with the renamed FOSS.IN we were able to get something.Imagine , in 2003 people were asking what FSF-India does [2] and in 2005 we got dedicated space for a stall.I have fond memories of the time me , Praveen and others were working to put the stall up for FSF-India[3].This was a big event where I represented FSF-India as a volunteer.I have been a long time supporter of free software and would continue to be.This is also reflective in my professional career as well.</p>

<p>Continuing on the journey , I am embarking on a new endeavor in my professional life.This one is going to make a few new frontiers again.</p>

<p>Ending this with words from Geetanjali.</p>

<p>Where The Mind is Without Fear
From Rabindranath Tagore&rsquo;s Geetanjali
——————————————————–</p>

<p>Where the mind is without fear
And the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up
Into fragments by narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake</p>

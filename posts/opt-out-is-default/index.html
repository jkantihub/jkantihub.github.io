    <h1 id="when-opt-in-became-default-and-made-you-into-a-product">When opt-in became default and made you into a product.</h1>
<p>The recent events on the DO community and the October Hack Fest has garnered enough attention of the community.The idea behind the fest looks good but the execution maybe not.</p>
<p>In this age of instant gratification and power hungry tools , it is imperative that we consider the consequences of our actions. It was around 2016 and in one of the geek conferences in India ,I heard about the power of the developer and the decisions he makes.There is a youtube link for the talk and I encourage you to look it up. Not that it was really the first time I was hearing about it but just a reminder.</p>
<p>The decisions made by developers should be in the best interest of the users , but unfortunately it is not the case.With the best minds on the planet spending their time to serve better ad&rsquo;s ( pun intended ) it is but forthcoming that there would be case of extremes and extremes they will be because the information retrieval systems are no longer reachable to the few informed , but to an entire community.</p>
<p>It is rather heartening to know that in this Information age there are a few people who would like to encourage opt-out as default.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please do not accept my consent of your cookie to be the acceptence of opt-in.</li>
<li>Please do not track me.</li>
<li>Please do not make me a product.</li>
<li>Please do not take the information which you are not &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; too.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="default-is-opt-outi-refuse-to-participate">&ldquo;Default is opt out.I refuse to participate.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>This was not how it was intended to be.The moment I open the browser there are a thousand trackers trying to know
each minute detail that they can lay their hands on.The situation is deplorable.</p>
<p>Let the power rest with you.</p>
